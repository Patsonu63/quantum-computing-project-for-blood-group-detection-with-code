# quantum-computing-project-for-blood-group-detection-with-code
### Quantum Computing Project for Blood Group Detection is an innovative idea! However, it's important to note: quantum computing currently isn't practically used for tasks like image classification or blood group detection, which are better handled by classical machine learning. But for learning purposes, we can create a hybrid quantum-classical ML model using Quantum Machine Learning (QML) concepts with PennyLane or Qiskit.

### 🧬 Project: Blood Group Detection using Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model
#### 👨‍🔬 Overview
We’ll simulate blood group detection using a dummy dataset (e.g., based on traits or synthetic markers), and implement a variational quantum circuit classifier (VQC) using PennyLane + scikit-learn.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
## Python

## PennyLane (for quantum circuit simulation)

## scikit-learn

## NumPy

### We'll simulate a dataset with features and target labels as blood groups: A, B, AB, O.

### 🔬 Conclusion
This project shows how Quantum ML models like variational quantum classifiers (VQCs) can be trained to detect blood types in a simulated setting. In real applications, you'd integrate biomedical data or image-based datasets (like blood smear microscopy) using classical ML, possibly enhanced by QML.
